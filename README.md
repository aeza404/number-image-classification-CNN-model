# number-image-classification-CNN-model
This lab focuses on implementing and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow Keras to solve the classic machine learning problem of handwritten digit recognition. Using the MNIST dataset, containing 70,000 grayscale images of digits 0 through 9, you define the ML task as a multiclass classification problem where the label is the digit pictured, and the features are the 28×28 pixel intensity values of the handwritten images. After loading the dataset using keras.datasets.mnist, you explore the raw data structure, inspect example images, and visualize them using Seaborn and Matplotlib to build intuition about the dataset before modeling.

Once the data is inspected, you prepare it for training by scaling pixel values to the range [0, 1] and reshaping the images into the 4-dimensional format required by CNNs. You then construct a deep CNN model using Keras’ Sequential API, building a layered architecture that includes multiple convolutional layers (with increasing filter sizes), batch normalization layers, ReLU activations, and a global average pooling layer. This structure extracts spatial patterns in handwriting, such as curves and strokes, before passing the learned representations into a final dense output layer with 10 units, one for each possible digit. You define the loss function (SparseCategoricalCrossentropy), optimizer (SGD with a learning rate of 0.1), and evaluation metric (accuracy), and compile the model for training.

The final stage of the lab involves fitting the model on 60,000 training images and evaluating it on the 10,000-image test set. After running one epoch of training, you measure performance by computing loss and accuracy on the unseen test data, achieving strong results given the small number of epochs. You also generate predictions for individual test images and visualize them using the provided plot_imgs() function, comparing predicted digits to the actual images. This hands-on workflow demonstrates the full process of building, training, and evaluating a CNN for image classification using Keras, mirroring modern approaches used in real-world computer vision systems.
